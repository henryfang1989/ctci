# question: You are given a list of projects and
# list of dependencies (which is a lost of pairs
# of projects, where the second projects dependent
# on the first prject). All of a project's  dependencies
# must be built before the project is. Find a build
# order that will allow the projects to be built.
# If there is no valid build order, return an error.


# topological sort
# build a project graph and count each projects'
# dependencies and next projects.
# BFS to iterate all pojects without dependencies
# and record the order of iteration.
